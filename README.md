Developed an impactful mobile application called 'mSafe' that utilized GPS technology to track the user's location and send emergency notifications when they were in danger. Implemented this project using Kotlin for Android development, and XML for UI designing, and leveraged the power of Flutter Firebase integration.

The objective of mSafe was to provide users with a reliable safety solution, empowering them to feel secure wherever they went. The key features of this mobile application include:

1. Location Tracking: Utilized GPS capabilities to continuously track the user's real-time location. Ensured accurate and reliable location updates to enable swift emergency response.

2. Emergency Notifications: Implemented a feature that allowed users to trigger an emergency notification with a single tap. When activated, mSafe sent an immediate distress signal to predefined emergency contacts, providing them with the user's location details.

3. User Interface and Experience: Created an intuitive and visually appealing user interface using XML and Flutter Firebase. Designed a seamless user experience that simplifies the process of initiating emergency notifications and accessing safety features.

4. Firebase Integration: Utilized Flutter Firebase integration to enable efficient handling and storage of user data, including emergency contacts, location history, and notification delivery. Leverages Firebase Authentication for secure user registration and login functionality.

5. Notifications and Alerts: Implemented push notifications and in-app alerts to keep users informed about their safety status, such as confirming the successful dispatch of an emergency notification or notifying them of nearby emergency services.

6. Customization and Settings: Allowed users to customize their emergency contact list, modify notification settings, and configure additional safety features as per their preferences.

7. Testing and Deployment: Conducted comprehensive testing to ensure the stability, reliability, and responsiveness of the 'mSafe' application. Deployed the app to a mobile platform, such as Android, for users to download
